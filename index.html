        <h1>Oleg Fabrikator</h1>
        <div class="text"> I don't know if I need programming, unfortunately.
            Maybe I didn't express it that way, or rather,
            it's that I don't understand who I will be in the IT world
            and if I will be at all. I am currently studying at Sh++ programming school.
            Profile course with Node.JS. I have a passion for chess.
            As in chess, in programming I am fascinated by solving complex (for me, of course) tasks.
